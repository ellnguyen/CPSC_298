Using a LLM to assist with coding involves knowing how to fine-tune and optimize it. 

After a prompt is taken from the user and goes through a tokenizer to quanitify the query, 
it goes to a mixture of experts to determine the focus of the prompt and the logic to use 
in the response. At the code stage, it starts from one state then determines the next potential 
states (next word). A bunch of different states are given for each word. By setting the 
temperature high, we widen the range of states, and the possible next states have low probability. 
By setting it low, we have fewer possible words with higher probability of showing up in the 
response. 

The state diagram for tokenized input can be greatly influenced by how the prompt is constructed. 
Even empty lines can drastically change how the coding assistant responds. The context window 
is a set of possible prompts or inputs that the LLM makes responses and predictions for. A 
bigger context window allows the LLM to make more sense out of the text. 

Tiktokenizer is a tool that calculates the number of tokens for a given prompt to a LLM, 
and we can use it to gain some insight about the decision-making behind a LLM.

I used LM Studio with the model described below: 

TheBloke/deepseek-coder-6.7B-instruct-GGUF/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct.Q2_K.gguf

After loading the deepseek model, my first prompt to the chatbot was:

"write python code that adds two numbers"

It responded with:

Sure, here is a simple Python function to add two numbers:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
You can use it like this:
```python
result = add(5, 3)
print(result) # Outputs: 8
```

The contents of this response is pasted into the file GeneratedPythonProgram.py

The code is able to run, and it accurately calculates the sum of two numbers.

This response took approximately 17 minutes, required up to 80.13% of CPU, and up to 3.50 GB RAM.

The next prompt was:

"please explain what that function does step by step"

And the response was:

Absolutely, here's a breakdown of the add function:

1. The function is defined with two parameters (`a` and `b`). These are placeholders for any values you want to use when calling the function later in your code. 

2. Inside the function, we have the line `return a + b`. This computes the sum of `a` and `b` and returns it as the result of the function.

3. When you call this function with two arguments (for instance, `add(5, 3)`), Python will replace these values in order to compute the equation on that line, giving the result of `8`. So this function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.

This response took approximately 11 minutes.

Overall, I think it did a pretty good job creating a function to add two numbers and describing how 

the function works. The timing however was very slow, and this could be due to the resource limitations 

that comes from running the LLM locally.
